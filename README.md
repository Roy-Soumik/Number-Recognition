# Number Recongnition

This project demonstrates building a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy for image classification. The network is designed to recognize and classify images with a high degree of accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Custom Neural Network**: Implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy.
- **Image Classification**: Trained to classify images with ~85% accuracy.
- **Core Components**: Includes forward and backward propagation, ReLU activation function, and softmax output layer.
- **Optimization**: Utilized gradient descent for model training and optimization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
